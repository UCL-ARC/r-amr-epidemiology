::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- To be able to explore relationships between variables
- To be able to calculate predicted variables and residuals 
- To be able to construct linear regression models
- To be able to check assumptions for linear regressiona models
- To be able to present model outcomes using Broom

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How can I explore relationships between variables in my data?
- How can I check that my data is suitable for use in a linear regression model?
- How can I present model outputs in an easier to read way?

## Data

```{r libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# We will need this library and this data later.
library(ggplot2)

lon_dims_imd_2019 <- read.csv(".data/English_IMD_2019_Domains_rebased_London_by_CDRC.csv")

```

We are going to use the data from the Consumer Data Research Centre, specifically the London IMD 2019 (English IMD 2019 Domains rebased).

Atribution: Data provided by the Consumer Data Research Centre, an ESRC Data Investment: ES/L011840/1, ES/L011891/1 

The statistical unit areas across the country are Lower layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs). We will explore the relationships between the different dimensions of the Indices of Multiple Deprivation.
