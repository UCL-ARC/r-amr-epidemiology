## Assumption Diagnostics and Regression Trouble Shooting

For accurate model interpretation and prediction, there are a number of assumptions about linear regression models that need to be verified.
These are:
* Linear Relationship: The core premise of multiple linear regression is the existence of a linear relationship between the dependent (outcome) variable and the independent variables. T
* Multivariate Normality: The analysis assumes that the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) are normally distributed. This assumption can be assessed by examining histograms or Q-Q plots of the residuals, or through statistical tests such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
* No Multicollinearity: It is essential that the independent variables are not too highly correlated with each other, a condition known as multicollinearity. This can be checked using:
  + Correlation matrices, where correlation coefficients should ideally be below 0.80.
  + Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), with VIF values above 10 indicating problematic multicollinearity.
* Homoscedasticity: The variance of error terms (residuals) should be consistent across all levels of the independent variables. 

We can perform a number of tests to see if the assumptions are met. 

We will first undertake some residual diagnostics using the package 'olsrr'.

### Residual Diagnostics

#### Residual QQ Plot
Plot for detecting violation of normality assumption.
```{r}
library(olsrr)

model1 <- lm(health_london_rank ~ livingEnv_london_rank + barriers_london_rank + la19nm, data = lon_dims_imd_2019)

ols_plot_resid_qq(model1)
```

#### Residual Normality Test
Test for detecting violation of normality assumption.
```{r}

ols_test_normality(model1)

```

Correlation between observed residuals and expected residuals under normality.
```{r}

ols_test_correlation(model1)

```
From these tests we can see that our assumptions are seemingly correct.

#### Residual vs Fitted Values Plot
We can create a scatter plot of residuals on the y axis and fitted values on the x axis to detect non-linearity, unequal error variances, and outliers.

Characteristics of a well behaved residual vs fitted plot:
* The residuals spread randomly around the 0 line indicating that the relationship is linear.
* The residuals form an approximate horizontal band around the 0 line indicating homogeneity of error variance.
* No one residual is visibly away from the random pattern of the residuals indicating that there are no outliers.

```{r}

ols_plot_resid_fit(model1)

```

#### Residual Histogram
Additionally, we can create a histogram of residuals for detecting violation of normality assumption.

```{r}

ols_plot_resid_hist(model1)

```

### Additional Diagnostics
In addition the residual diagnostics, we can also assess our model for Heteroskedasticity and Multicollinearity
